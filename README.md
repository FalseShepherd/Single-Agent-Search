# Single-Agent-Search

Programs written for a Single Agent Search course taught by Nathan Sturtevant.

These programs range from simple implementations of Breadth/Depth First Search to IDA* to Furthest Pivot A*. The course covered various NPK search methods of searching through exponential and polynomial state spaces, and programs were meant to be written in a generic fashion that would allow their reuse for other types of state spaces.

all of these programs were written in coordination by Nathan Saslavsky (zorg24), and myself respectively.
