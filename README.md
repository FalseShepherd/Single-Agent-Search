# Single-Agent-Search

Search Programs 
Course: Single Agent Search 
Professor: Dr. Nathan Sturtevant

These programs range from simple implementations of Breadth/Depth First Search to IDA* to Furthest Pivot A*. The programs use NPK search methods to search through exponential and polynomial state spaces. All included Search Algorithms are written in a generic fashion to allow their reuse for specific search cases. 

All programs were written by Nathan Saslavsky (zorg24), and myself respectively.
